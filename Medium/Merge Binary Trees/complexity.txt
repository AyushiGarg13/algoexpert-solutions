Time = O(n)
Space = O(h)

n = no. of nodes in the smaller tree (as we just copy the other tree values if null is found)
h = height of the smaller binary tree (since we don't need to have recursive call stacks of the other larger tree)

Iterative approach can also be used, but has same time & space complexity.
That approach uses DFS with stacks to keep track of the nodes in each tree.
