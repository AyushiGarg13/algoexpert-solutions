Time = O(n)
Space = O(1)
n = length of input array

Peak is a point preceeded by strictly increasing numbers followed by strictly decreasing numbers

In this approach, we are NOT maintaining the direction of the flow as well.
The other approach was quite complex to implement but a little bit faster than this.
Time comp for this = O(n+2/3) as we might need to reiterate on the left side.
This algo finds the peak point and then traverses in both direction to find it's length.
