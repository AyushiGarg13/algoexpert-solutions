Time = O(n)
Space = O(n)
n = length of input array

Solution:

Left and right arrays are created to store the multiplicated values
from the left and the right side of the element in array.
They are then multiplied together to create the output.

To optimize it, we combine the creation of right array 
and its multiplication with left to create output array.
