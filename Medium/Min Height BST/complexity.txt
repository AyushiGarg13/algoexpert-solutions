Time = O(n)
Space = O(n)

n = no. of nodes in BST

The default insert method takes log n time to insert each node.
Operation is called on n nodes, hence O(nlogn)
If we can keep track of the node where to insert the next node, instead of using the given
function then we can bypass the log n complexity.
