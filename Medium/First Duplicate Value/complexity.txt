Time = O(n)
Space = O(1)
n = length of input array

Solution:

we are allowed to mutate the array
AND -> ARRAY CONTAINS VALUES ONLY FROM 1 TO N (no. of elements)

so we can use this information
we'll map our elements to a certain index i.e elem - 1
we'll check if the element on that index is -ve
if not, then we make the elem negative and move to next one

if yes, then we know this must have been visited by same elem already
and hence that's our first duplicate value

we can do thi only because array consists of 1 TO N
