Time = O(n)
Space = O(n) 

n = no. of nodes in the Binary Tree

-> Space -> for recursive call stacks, in average case = log n, in worst case = n.
Plus, space used by output array = number of leaf nodes, which cannot exceed n.
Also, approximately we can have around (a little less than) n/2 nodes
at the leaf level. Actual nodes at leaf level = 2^level.
