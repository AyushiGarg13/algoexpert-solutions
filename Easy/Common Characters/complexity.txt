Time = O(n x m)
Space = O(m)

n = no. of strings
m = unique characters in the longest string

Solution:
1. Find the smallest string
2. The characters in the smallest string are a key reference, at most all of them should be in all the string
3. Create set for all strings
4. Loop through the smallest string set
5. If character of smallest string set in not found in other set, then its not a common char.
6. Remove it
7. At the end, whatever is left in the smallest string set is our answer.
