Time = O(n)
Space = O(n)
n = length of input array

Solution:

Hash Table (unordered_map/unordered_set) is used to reduce time complexity.
But space complexity increases.
If item is encountered in array => x, then targetSum - x = y, should be in the map.
If y is not found, then x is added in hash table.
